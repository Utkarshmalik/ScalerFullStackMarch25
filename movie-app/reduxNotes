Store :  The store is the central place where all the state of your application lives. It acts as a single source of truth, meaning all the data your app needs to function is stored here.


Actions:

An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened in your application. Actions are used to tell the store what kind of update is needed for the state.

const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  payload: 'Learn Redux',
};



On Trigger


Dispatching an Action: You use the dispatch function to send an action to the store:

store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: 'Learn Redux' });

store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT_COUNTER'});



Reducers

A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as input and returns a new state.

Reducers specify how the state should change in response to an action.


function countReducer(state, action){
        switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
        return { ...state, value: state.value + 1 };
        case 'DECREMENT':
        return { ...state, value: state.value - 1 };
        default:
        return state;
    }

}



Store holds the state of your app.
Actions describe what you want to do (e.g., "Increment the counter").
Dispatch sends the action to the store.
Reducers decide how the state should change based on the action.




 Vanilla Redux:

It is boilerplate-heavy, especially for beginners. You have to write a lot of repetitive code:

Setting up actions, reducers, and action creators.
Managing middleware like redux-thunk for async actions.
Handling immutable state updates can be tricky.


What is Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit is the official, modern way to use Redux. It simplifies the setup and reduces boilerplate, making Redux easier to learn and use.






Slice

The term "slice" typically refers to a slice of the Redux state. It is a portion of the global state managed by Redux, usually representing a specific 
feature or domain of your application.

In Redux Toolkit (RTK), a "slice" is a concept introduced to simplify Redux logic. A slice is essentially a reducer combined with actions for a particular feature or part of the state. It is created using createSlice from Redux Toolkit, which helps automatically generate action creators and reducers for managing state in a concise way.


Selectors:

A selector is a function that extracts a specific piece of state from the store. 

const selectCounterValue = (state) => state.counter.value;




Traditionally, handling async actions with Redux involved:

 Dispatching separate actions for "loading", "success", and "error".
 Writing lots of boilerplate code to handle these states.




createAsyncThunk

createAsyncThunk is a utility provided by Redux Toolkit to handle asynchronous operations, 
like fetching data from an API, in a structured and clean way.

 With createAsyncThunk, Redux Toolkit automatically generates actions for each state (pending, fulfilled, rejected) and simplifies the logic.



It simplifies managing the three common states of an async operation:

    Pending: The async task has started (e.g., API call is in progress).
    Fulfilled: The async task has completed successfully.
    Rejected: The async task failed (e.g., due to network errors).




    How it works ? 


  const asyncThunk = createAsyncThunk("sliceName/actionName", asyncFunction);

sliceName/actionName: A string identifier for the async action (e.g., "user/fetchUsers").


asyncFunction:  The actual async function to perform the task (e.g., an API call). It can:
Return data on success.
Throw an error or use rejectWithValue on failure.



 Generated Actions
  When you use createAsyncThunk, Redux Toolkit automatically generates:

    pending action: Dispatched when the async task starts.
    fulfilled action: Dispatched when the async task succeeds.
    rejected action: Dispatched when the async task fails.






Reducers 

Handles actions local to the slice (e.g., actions you define within the slice).	

increment, decrement, or toggling a flag.	


Extra Reducers 

Handles external actions (e.g., actions created by createAsyncThunk or actions from other slices).

fetchUsers.pending, fetchUsers.fulfilled, or shared actions.





 What is builder in extraReducers?
The builder in extraReducers is a functional utility provided by Redux Toolkit that allows you to define how your state changes in response to specific external actions (like those generated by createAsyncThunk).
