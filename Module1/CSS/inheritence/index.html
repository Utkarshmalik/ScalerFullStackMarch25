<!-- In CSS, inheritance refers to the mechanism by which some property values are passed down from a parent element to its children. When a property is inherited, the child element gets the value of that property from its parent, unless it is explicitly overridden.
 -->

<!-- 
 Inherited Properties: Some CSS properties naturally inherit values from their parent element, such as color, font-family, font-size, line-height, text-align, etc.
 -->

 <!-- Non-Inherited Properties: Most layout and box model-related properties, such as margin, padding, border, width, height, background, etc., are not inherited by default. -->
