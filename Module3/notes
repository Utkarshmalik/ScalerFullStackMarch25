Mounting 
Mounting is the stage where the component is being created and inserted into the UI. It's like setting up the stage before the play begins.


Updating
Updating occurs after the component has been mounted and involves any changes to the componentâ€™s state or props (the parameters passed into a component). 



Unmounting
Unmounting is the final phase of the component lifecycle.
